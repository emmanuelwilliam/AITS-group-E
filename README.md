The Academic Tracking System, also known as AITS, is an IT solution to the many academic problems being faced in academic institutions, with its development being based on University environments
but also applies to all institutions of learning, as there are general problems. The problems include getting issues to lecturers, lecturers solving the issues, updating of marks, and monitoring of 
lecturers to ensure that they are working on the issues assigned to them. Let's not forget that it also gives the institution a general picture of the students' struggles. In this way, the institution can plan better and make more informed decisions regarding the students, lecturers
and academic registrar.
