Documentary for the Academic Issue Tracking System (AITS)
****
The Academic Issue Tracking System (AITS) is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to address the challenges students and administrators face in managing academic issues at Makerere University. The system provides a streamlined workflow for logging, tracking, and resolving academic issues such as missing marks, appeals, and corrections. By integrating modern technologies like Django for the backend and React for the frontend, AITS ensures a seamless and efficient user experience for all stakeholders, including students, lecturers, and the academic registrar.

The development of AITS follows the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), beginning with thorough planning and requirements analysis. During the initial phases, key user personas were identified, such as students like Amina Nanyonga, who need a simple way to submit and track issues, and administrators like Mr. Mugisha Paul, who require tools to manage and assign issues efficiently. These personas helped shape the system's functionalities, ensuring it meets real-world needs. User stories and use cases were then developed to translate these needs into actionable features, such as issue submission, assignment, and resolution workflows.


The system architecture of AITS is built on a robust full-stack framework. The frontend, developed with React, offers a dynamic and responsive interface, while the backend, powered by Django, handles business logic and database interactions. PostgreSQL serves as the database, ensuring data integrity and scalability. The architecture also includes RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, enabling features like real-time notifications and status updates. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict access based on user roles, ensuring security and accountability.
